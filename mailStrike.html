                Thunderbird is an open-source email client created by the Mozilla project in the mid-2000s as the companion to Firefox. It was designed to provide a free, privacy-respecting alternative to commercial mail applications, and over the years it grew with features like powerful filters, multi-account support, add-ons, and built-in encryption. After a period where development slowed down around 2015, the community revived the project, reorganized it, modernized the interface, and continued improving performance and stability. Thunderbird remains fully free and community-driven, which is one of its biggest strengths.

Its advantages include strong privacy protection, excellent support for standard email protocols, a high level of customization through extensions, and the ability to manage many accounts efficiently. However, it also has some drawbacks, such as an interface that can feel outdated, occasional heaviness when handling very large mailboxes, and the lack of an official mobile version, which many users consider a major limitation. Despite its imperfections, it is still one of the most trusted and flexible open-source mail clients available.
