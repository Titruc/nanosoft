               Microsoft Edge is a browser developed by Microsoft and the default browser for Windows.
However, “default” doesn’t necessarily mean “good.” Microsoft Edge is based on Chromium, an “open-source” (free-to-use) version of Google’s browser engine, just like many other browsers.

The browser integrates numerous connected services — cloud synchronization, smart suggestions, diagnostic data collection — which, combined, can create a very detailed picture of a user’s activity. Some practices, such as enabling modules by default that send information to Microsoft to improve performance or personalize the experience, may be seen as intrusive if the user is not fully aware of them.

These mechanisms do not necessarily imply misuse, but they do illustrate a potential risk: the more a browser centralizes data, the greater the temptation or possibility of expanding its use becomes. This highlights the importance of checking privacy settings, limiting unnecessary data sharing, and staying vigilant about tools that integrate deeply into our daily browsing. Especially for a NIRD member.
