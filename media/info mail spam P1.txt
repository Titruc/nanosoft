MAIL 1 : The First Mission (Le Boss)
---
From: LetimCook@nooknook.com
Object: Your First Mission

Hello Clin,
I am sending you this nooknook to give you your first assignment: please send a nooknook to your colleagues JayneRosenberg@nooknook.com, RexSmith@nooknook.com, and DennisMarty@nooknook.com, instructing them to repair the machines.

Thank you for doing this.

MAIL 2 : Try Out Waterfox (Le Pote Nerd)
---
From: YourFriendTheNerd@tuta.com
Object: Try this out, man, it's incredible!

Hey Clin, how are you? I'm doing well, personally.
I'm writing to tell you that I've discovered something incredible! I think you use Corner like everyone else. I found something even better called **Waterfox**.

There are no pop-ups, no notifications, no long loading times, my data is protected, and the crash issues have been resolved. As a bonus, Google can't stop you from deleting YouTube ads.

MAIL 3 : Production Issue - Machine Specs (Le Collègue)
---
From: Colleague@nooknook.com (Assumed)
Object: Machine Specification Request

Hello Clin Bates,

We have a problem in production, and for some reason, I can't access the site that provides the machine specifications. Can you please copy the specifications for machine **03 r54FX3D** from this link so I can write an issue report?

www.fratro.com/our_machines/03_r54FX3D

MAIL 4 : Libre Office Alternative (Le Pote Nerd)
---
From: YourFriendTheNerd@tuta.com
Object: Free Desk™ Alternative for Reports

Hello,

Apparently, they're having problems paying the license for **Desk™** due to poor financial management. It just so happens that I have the perfect alternative that doesn't need any subscription. If you need to write an issue or a report while they fix this, install it.

**freedesk.msi**

Your best colleague
