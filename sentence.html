              Microsoft Word is a word-processing software used worldwide, even though it has its fair share of shortcomings. Word is now shifting toward a subscription-based model through Microsoft 365, which pushes users to pay regularly to access the full range of features or simply to remain compatible with the most recent formats. This approach can feel restrictive, especially when it replaces a one-time license purchase with ongoing payments.

Moreover, Word is now closely tied to Microsoft’s cloud services, such as OneDrive and SharePoint. By default, the software encourages online storage, real-time collaboration, and automatic document synchronization. While convenient, these features involve sending information to Microsoft’s servers, raising concerns about privacy and data control. This highlights the importance of properly configuring privacy settings, choosing carefully where documents are stored, and staying attentive to the implications a cloud service may have on managing sensitive data — particularly for a NIRD member.
